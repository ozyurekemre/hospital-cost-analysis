Hospital Service Cost Analysis – Operational & Financial Performance Review

📄 Based on internal 2025 service performance data
Author: Emre Özyürek

🎯 Project Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive cost analysis for a multi-hospital network, evaluating:

Service activity

Engineer performance

Parts utilization

Equipment age impact

Weather-related cost patterns

Cost hotspots by hospital region

Strategic cost reduction opportunities

The study uses real operational patterns such as aging medical devices, engineer certification levels, regional workload imbalance, and seasonal service spikes to identify where cost optimization actions will have the highest impact.

📌 Executive Summary

Based on 2025 service operations:

Total Parts Cost: $117,160

Average Service Duration: 53 minutes
Source: "Total Cost Overview" on page 1

Increasing costs are driven primarily by:

Aging instruments

High component replacement frequency

Low diagnostic efficiency among Level 1 engineers

Regional concentration of service requests

A unified strategic plan shows 25–30% potential annual cost reduction, lowering projected 2026 cost to $82K–$85K.

🧠 Analysis Components (from PDF)
1. Total Cost Overview

Total cost: $117,160

Average duration: 53 min

Cost increases linked to aging instruments, not longer labor time
Source: Page 1

2. Cost Drivers by Instrument Model

From the bar charts on page 1:

Model C and Model D generate the highest cost

Reason: component aging + high part usage

Recommended: targeted supplier evaluation & preventive replacement
→ Expected savings: 10–15%
Source: Page 1

3. Engineer Certification Impact

According to "Engineer Certification Impact" bar chart (page 1):

Level 1 engineers = 29% of total cost
→ Despite shorter service time, they cause more part replacements

Experts = only 19% of total cost
→ Highest precision, fewer repeat visits

Key insight:
Training Level 1 engineers in diagnostics reduces unnecessary part swaps.

4. Hospital Cost Hotspots (Regional)

Bar chart on page 1 shows:

Highest cost regions:

Sheffield

Newcastle

Bristol

Leeds

→ These top 4 hospitals account for 60% of total cost.
Source: Page 2 – Action Plan Table & Page 1 chart

Recommendation:
Deploy regional spare-part hubs & more experienced engineers to reduce downtime.

5. Parts Cost by Equipment Age

Pie chart on page 1:

Instruments aged 3–5 years = 36% of cost

6–8 years = 28.8%

9+ years = 19.3%
→ Combined = 65%+ of total parts cost
Source: Page 1

Recommendation:
Introduce 6-year lifecycle renewal → estimated 20% cost reduction.

6. Monthly Cost Distribution

Chart on page 1 shows:

Cost spikes during June–September, peaking around $28,000
→ Due to weather-driven stress on equipment & higher field activity
Source: Page 1

Recommendation:
Shift preventive maintenance BEFORE seasonal spikes.

7. Weather Impact on Service Cost (Page 2)

Rainy + snowy months represent:

~40% of total annual cost

Increased electrical & sensor module failures
Source: Page 2

Recommendation:
Weather readiness program & moisture-sensitive part stocking → 3–5% savings.

8. Maintenance Type Impact

From the charts (page 2):

Repairs & upgrades drive most of the cost & duration

Routine checks are efficient but under-utilized

Control units & sensor modules = 58%+ of total parts cost
Source: Page 2

Recommendation:
Predictive replacement for failure-prone modules.

9. Shift Type Impact

Shift distribution:

Afternoon: 35.6%

Night: 34.6%

Morning: 29.8%
Source: Page 2

Insight:
Night + afternoon = 70% of cost → reactive maintenance dominates.

Recommendation:
Assign expert engineers to high-cost shifts.
